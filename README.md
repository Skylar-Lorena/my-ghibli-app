# LORENAH'S GHIBLI APP

A simple fan webapp for exploring the films and characters of Studio Ghibli. 

>The project is hosted [here](https://skylar-lorena.github.io/my-ghibli-app/).

>Video Walkthrough [here]().

## General Information
- This app allows users to explore information about the films of Studio Ghibli. 
- The app uses a Heroku deployed JSON-server I built to store it's data.
- Created as my JavaScript project for FlatIron School's Software Engineering Bootcamp.



## Languages
This project is created with:

* JavaScript
* HTML
* CSS

## Room for Improvement

- The JSON server is missing a number of major characters. Some films have zero character data.

To-Do:
- Complete css styles for each film.
- Add JS that changes page styling depending on the film being viewed.
